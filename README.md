The wine dataset (related to the wine making process) used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains 4,898 white wines and has 12 fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. 

This dataset has 12 features that determines the quality of the wine. 
• Fixed acidity is a measurement of the total concentration of titratable acids and free hydrogen ions present in the wine. 
• Volatile acidity which is mostly caused by bacteria in the wine creating acetic acid, could be an indicator of spoilage, or errors in the manufacturing processes — caused by things like damaged grapes, wine exposed to air, and so on. 
• Citric acid acts as a preservative and is added to wines to increase acidity, complement a specific flavour or prevent ferric hazes. 
• Residual Sugar refers to any natural grape sugars that are left over after fermentation ceases. 
• The amount of chlorides present in a wine is usually an indicator of its “saltiness.” Too much saltiness is considered undesirable. The right proportion can make the wine more savoury. 
• Free sulphur dioxide is that which is unbound to compounds in the wine and is, therefore, able to exert an antioxidant/preservative action. 
• Total Sulphur Dioxide (TSO2) is the portion of SO2 that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine such as aldehydes, pigments, or sugars. 
• Density can be used to measure the alcohol concentration in wines. Sweeter wines generally have higher densities. 
• pH describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). 
• Sulphates are salts of sulfuric acid. 
• Alcohol measures the level of ethanol (taste) gas in wine. 
• 'quality' feature is dependent variable and others are independent variables.
